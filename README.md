## Talin's Note

- I transplant customer portal to this project.Since the customer has already seen and agreed with the customer portal, I think it's best to keep the original ui to the greatest extent possible.However, if some of these interfaces are really awkward, feel free to change them.
- I didn't find where to modify menu title.
- All pages have rich comments to indicate what kind of requests, parameters and reponse needed.
- I didn't apply api gateway and token things.
- I didn't find where to modify theme, we could do it later.
- Although the vs code reports errors, they don't actually affect the run, ESLint is a bit too restrictive
